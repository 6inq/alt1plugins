## Common Issues & Solutions

### ‚ùå Alt1 Status Shows "Alt1 library not found"
- **Solution**: Make sure you're opening the plugin through Alt1's app browser, not regular browser

### ‚ùå "Alt1 connected" but features don't work
- **Solution**: Check permissions - make sure `capture`, `ocr`, `overlay`, and `chatbox` are granted
- Try clicking "Test Detection" in Settings tab

### ‚ùå Auto-detection not working
- **Solution**: 
  1. Enable Debug Mode in Settings
  2. Check debug output to see what OCR is reading
  3. Adjust detection regions if needed
  4. Make sure GE interface is visible on screen
  5. Try manual entry as fallback

### ‚ùå Chat monitoring not detecting messages
- **Solution**:
  1. Make sure chatbox permission is granted
  2. Check that ChatboxReader initialized (check browser console)
  3. Verify chat messages are in the visible chat area
  4. Try typing in chat to ensure it's being read

### ‚ùå GE Limits not showing
- **Solution**:
  1. Check browser console for API errors
  2. May need CORS setup if testing locally
  3. Fallback local database should still work
  4. Manual entry still works without limits

## Quick Test Script

Run through this quick checklist:

```
1. Open plugin in Alt1 ‚Üí Should see "Alt1 connected"
2. Add manual buy order ‚Üí Should appear in list
3. Add manual sell order ‚Üí Should appear in list
4. Link them ‚Üí Should show linked indicator
5. Go to Statistics tab ‚Üí Should see active order count = 2
6. Price check an item in GE ‚Üí Should appear in Item Tracking
7. Check Item Tracking ‚Üí Should show GE Limit and Total at Limit

9. Reset everything ‚Üí Should clear all data
10. Import data ‚Üí Should restore previous data
```

## Testing with Real GE Orders

For full testing with actual GE orders:

1. **Small Test Flip**
   - Buy a cheap item (e.g., 100 logs)
   - Link buy and sell order
   - Wait for both to complete
   - Verify auto-profit calculation works

2. **Partial Completion Test**
   - Place a buy order for a high-volume item
   - Watch for partial completion messages
   - Verify progress updates in real-time

3. **Multiple Orders**
   - Track several different items
   - Verify each updates independently
   - Check statistics reflect all activity

## Browser Console Debugging

Open browser console (F12) to see:
- Plugin initialization messages
- OCR detection logs
- Chat message detection
- API fetch results
- Any errors

Look for:
- `"Alt1 connected"`
- `"GE limits database loaded: X items"`
- `"Tracked: [item] ..."`
- `"Buy/Sell update: ..."`

## Next Steps After Testing

1. Fix any bugs found
2. Adjust detection regions if OCR isn't accurate
3. Update GE limits database if common items missing
4. Test with different screen resolutions
5. Verify all edge cases work properly
